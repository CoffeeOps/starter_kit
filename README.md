## CoffeeOps Starter Kit

So you want to start your own CoffeeOps?

When first starting out, you'll probably have just a few folks (2-3). So, let everyone decide on the style of the meeting. Once, you have 7 or more folks, go ahead with the lean coffee approach for the meeting (please see http://leancoffee.org/ for more info).

Here are your key factors for success:

1. Consistency
2. Availability and accessibility of the chosen venue
  a) For example, is it easy to get to for the people you are targeting. Check for steps/elevator availability
3. Provide a few ice breaker ideas to get folks talking
4. "Marketing" .. the how you let folks know the event is happening
