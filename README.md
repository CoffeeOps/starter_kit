## CoffeeOps Starter Kit

### So you want to start your own CoffeeOps?

When first starting out, you'll probably have just a few folks (2-3). So, let everyone decide on the style of the meeting. Once you have 7 or more folks, go ahead with the lean coffee approach for the meeting (please see [http://leancoffee.org/](http://leancoffee.org/) for more info).

### Here are your key factors for success:

1. Consistency. Make sure there is always someone there on meeting day.
2. Availability and accessibility of the chosen venue
   * For example, is it easy to get to for the people you are targeting? Check for steps/elevator availability
   * What is the parking situation like?
3. Provide a few ice breaker ideas to get folks talking
4. **Marketing** .. the how you let folks know the event is happening
