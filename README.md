## CoffeeOps Starter Kit

### So you want to start your own CoffeeOps?

When first starting out, you'll probably have just a few folks (2-3). So, let everyone decide on the style of the meeting. Once you have 7 or more folks, go ahead with the lean coffee approach for the meeting (please see [http://leancoffee.org/](http://leancoffee.org/) for more info).

### Here are your key factors for success:

1. Consistency. Make sure there is always someone there on meeting day.
2. Availability and accessibility of the chosen venue
   * For example, is it easy to get to for the people you are targeting? Check for steps/elevator availability
   * What is the parking situation like?
   * Conduct a poll about locations 
3. Provide a few ice breaker ideas to get folks talking
4. **Marketing** .. the how you let folks know the event is happening
   * [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) is a good way to publicize your meetup in the beginning.
   * Slack. If there's a dev or ops oriented slack for your area, see if they have some sort of #meetup channel you can post announcements in.
   * [CoffeeOps slack](https:/coffeeops.slack.com) - If there isn't a #cityname channel, make one. Make a point of posting every meeting there so that new members of the slack can find out there's now a CoffeeOps in the area.
